  --title "Integration Testing: Validate Security Refactor with Real Data" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## üéØ Objective

Validate the comprehensive security refactor and production monitoring infrastructure with real-world data and scenarios.

## üîç Background

We've completed a comprehensive security refactor including:
- Fixed API key exposure vulnerability in FRED service
- Built secure HTTP client with proper authentication
- Added 48 security-focused tests
- Implemented production monitoring and health checks
- Created CI/CD security pipeline

**Now we need to validate this infrastructure works correctly with real data before adding new features.**

## üìã Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
- [ ] Configure integration test environment with real API keys
- [ ] Set up staging environment that mirrors production
- [ ] Ensure all monitoring and logging systems are active

### Phase 2: FRED API Integration Validation
- [ ] Test all FRED API endpoints with production keys
- [ ] Validate error handling with rate limits and API failures
- [ ] Confirm secure client prevents API key exposure in logs
- [ ] Test bulk data operations with real series

### Phase 3: Health Check & Monitoring Validation
- [ ] Validate health check endpoints with real API connectivity
- [ ] Test error tracking with real failure scenarios
- [ ] Confirm logging system properly redacts sensitive data
- [ ] Verify performance monitoring captures real metrics

### Phase 4: Deployment Verification
- [ ] Run `scripts/deploy-verify.sh` against staging environment
- [ ] Test all 4 verification gates (Build, Lint, Security, Docker)
- [ ] Validate rollback procedures work correctly
- [ ] Confirm CI/CD pipeline works end-to-end

### Phase 5: Documentation & Findings
- [ ] Document any issues found during testing
- [ ] Update runbook based on real-world scenarios
- [ ] Create recommendations for production deployment
- [ ] Validate security posture meets requirements

## üß™ Test Scenarios

**Happy Path:**
- Normal FRED API operations with various series
- Health checks during normal operation
- Monitoring during typical load

**Error Scenarios:**
- Invalid API keys
- Rate limit exceeded
- Network timeouts
- Malformed responses

**Security Scenarios:**
- Confirm no API keys in logs
- Validate error messages don't expose secrets
- Test authentication failure handling

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] All existing functionality works with real data
- [ ] Security infrastructure prevents data exposure
- [ ] Monitoring systems capture real operational metrics
- [ ] Deployment verification passes in staging environment
- [ ] Zero critical security findings
- [ ] Performance meets baseline requirements

## üìä Definition of Done

- [ ] All test scenarios pass
- [ ] Security validation complete
- [ ] Performance baselines established
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Ready for production deployment
