# Production Deployment Checklist

## ðŸš€ Stage 6: Production Deployment & Monitoring

### Environment Configuration

#### Required Environment Variables
- [ ] `FRED_API_KEY` - Production FRED API key (required)
- [ ] `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` - Production Alpha Vantage key (optional)
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production` - Environment identifier
- [ ] `PORT` - Application port (default: 3000)
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string (if applicable)

#### Security Configuration
- [ ] API keys stored in secure secret management system
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in codebase
- [ ] Environment variables validated on startup
- [ ] Rate limiting configured for API endpoints
- [ ] CORS properly configured for production domains

#### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Health check endpoints implemented
- [ ] Application logs configured with structured format
- [ ] Error tracking service configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring enabled
- [ ] Alerting rules configured for critical metrics

### Deployment Gates

#### Pre-Deployment Validation
- [ ] All CI/CD pipeline checks pass
  - [ ] Build succeeds
  - [ ] 48 security tests pass
  - [ ] Lint checks pass (or acceptable)
  - [ ] Secret scanning passes
  - [ ] Docker build succeeds
- [ ] Code review approved by human reviewer
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance baseline established

#### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Authentication works with production keys
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards show green status
- [ ] No critical errors in application logs
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable range

### Rollback Procedures

#### Immediate Rollback Triggers
- [ ] Health checks fail for >2 minutes
- [ ] Critical error rate >5%
- [ ] Response times >95th percentile threshold
- [ ] Authentication failures >10%

#### Rollback Process
1. [ ] Stop new traffic routing to failing deployment
2. [ ] Route traffic back to previous stable version
3. [ ] Verify previous version health checks
4. [ ] Document rollback reason and timestamp
5. [ ] Create incident report for post-mortem

### Success Criteria

#### Technical Metrics
- [ ] API response time P95 < 500ms
- [ ] Error rate < 1%
- [ ] Uptime > 99.9%
- [ ] Memory usage stable over 24 hours
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in dependencies

#### Business Metrics
- [ ] FRED API integration working correctly
- [ ] Alpha Vantage data fetching operational
- [ ] Dashboard metrics loading successfully
- [ ] No user-facing errors reported

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

#### First 24 Hours
- [ ] Monitor application logs continuously
- [ ] Check performance metrics every 15 minutes
- [ ] Verify API rate limits not exceeded
- [ ] Monitor error tracking dashboard
- [ ] Validate business metrics accuracy

#### First Week
- [ ] Daily health check review
- [ ] Weekly performance trend analysis
- [ ] Security scan results review
- [ ] User feedback collection and review
- [ ] Cost optimization opportunities identified

### Communication Plan

#### Stakeholder Notifications
- [ ] Deployment start notification sent
- [ ] Deployment completion confirmation
- [ ] Performance summary shared
- [ ] Any issues or incidents documented
- [ ] Success metrics communicated to team
